What is a Panitto?

#master: we should expand our panitto introduction!
A Panitto is a burrito that has been placed in the panini press at Ada. It's a beautiful thing, especially for a breakfast burrito.

blah blah blah 
Panitto Origins
The origin of the panitto began when Iris, Dianne's wonderful partner, started making breakfast burritos for Dianne. Because Dianne is awful at making her own breakfast.

One day, she brought her burrito to school, and instead of microwaving it like a sad loser, she put it in the panini press!

#Panittowork branch: We should add a recipe for a panitto here!

YAY PANITTO.
